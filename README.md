# Weather Programming Exercise

For this exercise, you will be utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API (http://openweathermap.org/API) 
to display the weather forecast for a city that the user selects.  An example API call is here:  
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=Chicago,IL.

The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate a strong understanding of building a single page 
application where the API is provided for you.

Story:  As an end user, I’d like to be able to see the 10 day forecast in another city so that I can know 
what clothing to pack for my vacation.

Acceptance Criteria:

The user can type a city name in a text box and the weather is displayed.

Forecast high and low temperatures are displayed in Fahrenheit.

The date for each day of the forecast along with an icon corresponding to the forecast is displayed.

The user should be able to switch views between a summary view and a detailed view.
Your submission will be reviewed based on the following criteria:

Correctness

Quality of unit tests

Application of Design Patterns with a modern JavaScript library

Demonstration of a Javascript workflow

Bonus Points

While you can do the exercise in whatever framework you are most comfortable in, 
we use Backbone, so that’s worth extra points.

Good style and CSS structure.
Please send a zip file to me with the code necessary to run 
your application as well as documentation of your Javascript workflow.  The zip file should only 
contain items that you would check into source control.

Feel free to send e-mails to that address if 
you have any questions about requirements.

The expectation is that you’ll complete the exercise within 48 hours of receipt
